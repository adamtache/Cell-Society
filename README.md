# Cell Society Design - Team 10
#Introduction
The goal of Cell Society is to design and implement a program that will allow the user to run and visualize various types of cell automata simulations. For each separate cell automata simulation, the user should be able to select between different options and decide what they of simulation he/she would like to see. There should also be extra implementation including a graph that will be displayed as the simulation is running, and this graph will show the population sizes of different cells as the simulation runs. In total, the most important consideration, in our view, is designing the program in such a way that it will be flexible with regards to adding new rules with simulations or overriding existing simulations.
